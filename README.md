# MSKMigrationSupport
Migration Support for PUM oriented applications. The PUM generator creates methods within the created
model code. One of these methods returns the information, which classes belong to a project.

The Migration support stuff is based on that and allows a migration of a project database ... either 
single threaded or multi-threaded.
